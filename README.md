## Installation

Add these lines in the head tag of your application.html.erb:
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap-theme.css">

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'devise-bootstrap-views'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Add some minor css fix to your rails asset pipeline manifest

    # SASS
    *= require devise_bootstrap_views

    # LESS
    *= require devise_bootstrap_views_less

Then you need to install the required translations in your `config/locales`. The  [devise-i18n-views](https://github.com/mcasimir/devise-i18n-views) project is no longer maintained after being merged into [devise-i18n](https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n), which is currently the best source for updated Devise translations. You can manually download locale dictionaries from [devise-i18n/rails/locales](https://github.com/tigrish/devise-i18n/tree/master/rails/locales) or generate them by running `devise:views:locale <chosen_locale>`:

``` sh
rails g devise:views:locale it
```

will generate `config/locales/devise.views.it.yml`.

## Customizing Views

The `devise:views:bootstrap_templates` generator will copy all views to your application, so you can modify the files as you wish:

``` sh
rails g devise:views:bootstrap_templates
```
Alternatively, you can also generate Haml or Slim templates instead of traditional ERB. Both can be generated with their respective commands below.

``` sh
rails g devise:views:bootstrap_haml_templates
```

``` sh
rails g devise:views:bootstrap_slim_templates
```
